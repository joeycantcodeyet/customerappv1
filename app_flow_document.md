# Treez Mobile Customer Management - App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a budtender first opens the app, they are greeted with a clean and professional login screen. The app relies on the existing Treez authentication system so that users enter their existing credentials in a secure manner. After entering their login details, the initial process requires the budtender to select the dispensary store where they are working. This selection is important as it ties the user’s session to a specific Treez store and ensures the correct permissions are applied. In cases of forgotten passwords, the interface provides a clear path to initiate password recovery using the existing process established by Treez. There is also an option for the user to sign out at any time from within the app, which subsequently resets the session and brings them back to the login screen.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon successful login and store selection, the app lands on a streamlined dashboard designed with speed and simplicity in mind. This home page is structured with a minimal header and an uncluttered layout that displays the essential options for immediate use. The primary area of focus is the customer verification section, which includes options to immediately start an ID scan with the device's camera or access the manual customer search. A navigation bar ensures that other functions such as accessing personal account settings or support information are always only a tap away. This dashboard serves as the central hub for all customer check-in activities and responds promptly to user input with clear, large call-to-action elements.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The first key feature in the workflow is the customer verification process where the budtender can quickly begin an ID scan. Once the budtender selects the scan option, the app activates the phone camera and integrates Scandit ID scanning technology to capture the details from a government issued ID. The scanning component is optimized to recognize IDs from all U.S. states and passports from the United States, Canada, and Mexico. If the scan result is clear and of high quality, the system automatically fills in the customer’s profile details using the data from the scanned ID while simultaneously running a real-time age verification. However, if the scan results are ambiguous or the quality of the image is poor, the app promptly directs the budtender to a manual customer creation screen. Here, the user can either search for an existing profile or fill out the customer details using smart auto-fill capabilities that help populate address and phone number fields with validations that ensure correctness.

Once a customer profile is either identified via scanning or manually created, the user is taken to a detailed customer profile page. In this interface, budtenders have the ability to update customer details, re-upload images of IDs, and assign customer groups. For any denied entry cases due to a flagged customer, the customer profile displays a prominent red alert banner. This alert explains the reason for the restriction and requires the budtender to acknowledge the alert by interacting with the designated button. After the alert is acknowledged, the interaction is automatically logged with details such as date, time, and budtender identification to support compliance measures. Each page features consistent navigation to allow easy return to the home dashboard or movement to other parts of the app without confusion.

## Settings and Account Management

The settings and account management section is designed to let the budtenders manage their personal information, update notification preferences, and review their authentication details. From this area, users can update details such as their contact information and preferred settings, ensuring a personalized experience that remains in sync with Treez. In addition to profile updates, the account management area also provides options to review and manage session settings such as signing out of the app. This section is seamlessly integrated into the main navigation, allowing users to return quickly to the customer check-in dashboard once they have finished updating their preferences.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The app is designed with robust error handling to ensure the budtender always knows what to do next. If the user enters invalid credentials during the sign-in process or if a password recovery action fails, clear error messages appear with instructions on how to correct the issue. During the ID scanning process, if the scan returns ambiguous or low-quality data, the app immediately instructs the budtender to use the manual customer creation process. For connectivity issues, such as when the Treez Customer API is not available or the internet connection is unstable, the app displays an informative graphic that advises the user to refresh the connection, check the internet, or contact support via <support@treez.io>. The error handling mechanism is designed to prevent any action that might result in compliance or operational risk, making sure that every error is addressed promptly before moving forward.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The journey in the Treez Mobile Customer Management app begins with a secure login that ties each budtender to their specific dispensary environment. Once the user logs in, the clear and uncluttered dashboard offers straightforward options for quick customer verification either through scanning a government-issued ID or through a manual search and creation process. The system’s design supports real-time age verification, automatic data population from scans, and alternatives when scanning is unsuccessful. In addition, the detailed customer profile and alert system work together to enhance compliance, while the settings and account management pages provide personal adjustments and safety control for budtenders. The app ensures that even error states or connectivity issues are addressed with clear instructions, ensuring that every moment within the app contributes to an overall efficient and compliant check-in process at cannabis dispensaries.
