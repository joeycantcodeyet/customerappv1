# Implementation plan

This implementation plan is organized into 5 main phases: Environment Setup, Frontend Development, Backend Integration, Integration, and Deployment. Each phase includes step-by-step actions with validations and precise file locations. Please review each step and ensure you have checked your project directory for existing configurations before executing any setup steps.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  **Prevalidation:** Check if a project directory for Treez Mobile Customer Management already exists. If it exists, review existing configuration and skip project initialization steps. (Reference: Project Overview)

2.  **Project Initialization:**

    *   Open your terminal and navigate to your desired workspace.
    *   Create a new React Native project with TypeScript using Lovable.dev recommendations:

    `npx react-native init TreezCustomerManagement --template react-native-template-typescript `(Reference: Tech Stack: Frontend - React Native with TypeScript)

    *   Validate by checking that the project directory (`TreezCustomerManagement/`) has been created with proper TypeScript support.

3.  **Directory Structure Setup:**

    *   In the project root, create a directory structure that includes folders for `screens`, `components`, `services`, and `assets`.
    *   **Validation:** Confirm folders exist using `ls` or file explorer.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  **Navigation Setup:**

    *   Create a navigation setup in `/src/navigation/` using React Navigation. Create file `Navigation.tsx` inside `/src/navigation/` to define the main navigation stack.
    *   **Validation:** Run the app and verify that navigation is working even if the screens are simple placeholders.

2.  **Login & Store Selection Screens:**

    *   Create `LoginScreen.tsx` in `/src/screens/` to handle Treez authentication using the existing system. Implement UI based on Treez branding and design guidelines (reference `customerappdesign-system.md`).
    *   Create `StoreSelectionScreen.tsx` in `/src/screens/` to enable users to select their store/organization/entity.
    *   **Validation:** Verify navigation from Login to Store Selection using dummy data.

3.  **ID Scanning Screen:**

    *   Create `IDScannerScreen.tsx` in `/src/screens/` to integrate Scandit ID scanning. Use Scandit’s SDK for real-time scanning.
    *   Include fallback instructions: if ID scan fails, display a prompt/button to “Create Customer Manually.”
    *   **Validation:** Test camera integration in emulator (or physical device) to ensure the Scandit scanner initializes.

4.  **Customer Search & Manual Creation Screens:**

    *   Create `CustomerSearchScreen.tsx` in `/src/screens/` for manually searching for customer profiles.
    *   Create `CustomerCreationScreen.tsx` in `/src/screens/` for manually creating a new customer. Include auto-fill fields for address and phone number with proper validation (e.g., use postal code APIs for address and regex for phone numbers).
    *   **Validation:** Simulate input with valid/invalid data and check the auto-validation messages.

5.  **Customer Profile Management Screen:**

    *   Create `CustomerProfileScreen.tsx` in `/src/screens/` where budtenders can update customer details and re-upload IDs.
    *   Ensure UI supports Treez branding (dark text on light backgrounds, green accents, large CTAs, clean list views, clear modals, and red alerts for error states).
    *   **Validation:** Test edit functionality and check that changes are reflected on the UI.

6.  **Alerts Handling:**

    *   Create a reusable component `RedAlert.tsx` in `/src/components/` for displaying red alerts when a banned or restricted customer is detected.
    *   This component should include the text for the reason of restriction and a confirmation button for the budtender to acknowledge before proceeding.
    *   **Validation:** Render the component on a test screen to verify its appearance and behavior.

7.  **Connectivity Indicator:**

    *   Create a component `ConnectivityWarning.tsx` in `/src/components/` that displays a graphic and instructs the user to refresh/check internet connectivity (and contact <support@treez.io>).
    *   Integrate this component on a global level where connectivity status is monitored.
    *   **Validation:** Simulate offline mode (e.g., disable network) and verify that the warning appears.

## Phase 3: Backend Integration

1.  **API Service Setup:**

    *   In `/src/services/`, create `TreezApiService.ts` to interface with the existing Treez Customer API and Treez authentication system. This service will include functions for login, store selection, customer search, customer creation, and profile update.
    *   **Validation:** Write unit tests in `/src/services/TreezApiService.test.ts` to verify that API calls are structured correctly.

2.  **ID Scan Fallback Handling:**

    *   Within `TreezApiService.ts`, implement logic so that if an ID scan fails, the manual customer creation flow is triggered. Log the incident and provide instructions to the budtender accordingly.
    *   **Validation:** Simulate a failed ID scan and confirm that the manual creation API endpoint is called.

3.  **Customer Alert Logging:**

    *   Develop logging functionality inside `TreezApiService.ts` to record interactions where a banned or restricted customer is flagged. Record date, time, and budtender ID for each incident.
    *   **Validation:** Check log entries in the development console or file (if logging locally) after testing a trigger.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  **Connect Frontend to API Service:**

    *   Update screens (Login, Customer Search, Customer Creation, Profile Management) to use functions from `TreezApiService.ts`.
    *   Example: On Login, call the authentication API; on Customer Search, query the Treez Customer API.
    *   **Validation:** Simulate a complete user flow in the emulator from login through the customer management process.

2.  **Error Handling & Connectivity Failures:**

    *   Integrate global error handling using React error boundaries. Ensure that connectivity-related issues trigger the `ConnectivityWarning` component.
    *   **Validation:** Test offline scenarios and ensure that errors prompt friendly guidance to check the internet connection.

3.  **Data and UI Synchronization:**

    *   Ensure that after actions like customer creation or profile updates, UI components refresh data by re-fetching from the Treez API.
    *   **Validation:** Verify that changes appear without requiring a manual app refresh.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  **Build Setup for iOS and Android:**

    *   Configure builds for both platforms. For iOS, ensure that all necessary certificates and provisioning profiles are set up. For Android, verify the signing configuration in `android/app/build.gradle`.
    *   **Validation:** Run `npx react-native run-ios` and `npx react-native run-android` to test builds locally.

2.  **Final Testing:**

    *   Perform end-to-end testing to confirm that all flows (login, store selection, ID scanning, manual customer management, alerts, and connectivity warnings) operate as expected.
    *   **Validation:** Use testing suites (e.g., Jest for unit tests, and Detox or Appium for integration tests) to validate at least 100% of critical user flow tests.

3.  **Prepare for App Store Submission:**

    *   Generate release builds, prepare necessary marketing materials and documentation per App Store and Google Play guidelines.
    *   **Validation:** Run final sanity checks using both TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play Internal Testing.

## Post Deployment Checklist

1.  **User Feedback & Iteration:**

    *   Monitor logs, analytics, and gather feedback from Treez dispensary staff to identify any improvements.
    *   Plan for quick iterative patches in case of urgent issues.

2.  **Documentation Update:**

    *   Update technical documentation and internal wikis to reflect implementation details, known issues, and release notes.

**Note:** Throughout the implementation, always refer to the design guidelines in `customerappdesign-system.md` and the project overview for compliance with Treez branding and functionality requirements. Each step has been validated against the summarized project details and technical requirements provided.

This plan should guide the complete development and integration of the Treez Mobile Customer Management app. Follow each step carefully and validate after every major code update.
